    <h1>Federated Learning Framework</h1>
    <p>This repository contains the code for a federated learning framework with a focus on optimizing client participation through dynamic client selection. The framework is designed to work with various datasets and incorporates techniques for secure aggregation and hierarchical prototyping. However, the code is still under development and not complete. Due to restrictions from the project funding agency, we are unable to release the complete code until the project is finished.</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The federated learning framework consists of several components, including data handling, client-side training, server-side aggregation, and techniques for optimizing client participation. The following sections provide an overview of the main components and their functionalities.</p>

    <h3>Data Handling</h3>
    <p>The <code>DataHandler</code> class is responsible for loading different datasets. It supports multiple datasets such as CURIAL, MIMIC-III, UCI Heart Disease, ChestMNIST, Brain Tumor Segmentation, PathMNIST, MIT-BIH Arrhythmia, and Pediatric MRI. It handles data preprocessing, scaling, and splitting into training, validation, and test sets. It uses PyTorch's <code>DataLoader</code> for efficient data loading and batching.</p>
    <div class="code-block">
        <pre>
class DataHandler:
    def __init__(self, dataset_name):
        # Initialize data handler
        pass

    def _load_dataset(self):
        # Load dataset based on dataset_name
        pass

    def prepare_data(self, batch_size=32):
        # Prepare data loaders for training, validation, and testing
        pass
        </pre>
    </div>

    <h3>Client Class</h3>
    <p>The <code>Client</code> class represents a client in the federated learning setup. Each client has its own dataset, model, and optimizer. It is responsible for training its local model and evaluating the model's performance.</p>
    <div class="code-block">
        <pre>
class Client:
    def __init__(self, client_id, train_loader, val_loader, test_loader):
        # Initialize client with its ID and data loaders
        pass

    def _create_model(self):
        # Create a neural network model based on the dataset
        pass

    def train(self, num_epochs=1):
        # Train the client's local model
        pass

    def evaluate(self, loader):
        # Evaluate the client's model on a given data loader
        pass
        </pre>
    </div>

    <h3>Server Class</h3>
    <p>The <code>Server</code> class manages multiple clients and aggregates their model updates. It also incorporates dynamic client selection and adaptive participation rates.</p>
    <div class="code-block">
        <pre>
class Server:
    def __init__(self, num_clients):
        # Initialize server with number of clients
        pass

    def register_client(self, client):
        # Register a client with the server
        pass

    def federated_train(self, num_rounds=10):
        # Perform federated training for a specified number of rounds
        pass

    def _evaluate_global_model_with_client(self, client_index):
        # Evaluate the global model with a specific client's contribution
        pass

    def _evaluate_global_model_without_client(self, peterm-client_index):
        # Evaluate the global model without a specific client's contribution
        pass

    def _update_global_model(self, client):
        # Update the global model with a client's model
        pass

    def evaluate_global_model(self):
        # Evaluate the global model
        pass

    def calculate_data_diversity(self, client):
        # Calculate data diversity of a client
        pass
        </pre>
    </div>

    <h3>Secure Aggregation</h3>
    <p>The <code>SecureAggregator</code> class implements the Paillier cryptosystem for secure aggregation of model updates. It includes key generation, encryption, aggregation, and decryption functions.</p>
    <div class="code-block">
        <pre>
class SecureAggregator:
    def __init__(self, bits=512):
        # Initialize with Paillier key generation
        pass

    def encrypt(self, plaintext):
        # Encrypt plaintext using Paillier cryptosystem
        pass

    def aggregate_encrypted(self, encrypted_values):
        # Aggregate encrypted values
        pass

    def decrypt(self, ciphertext):
        # Decrypt ciphertext using Paillier cryptosystem
        pass
        </pre>
    </div>

    <h3>Hierarchical Prototyping</h3>
    <p>The <code>HierarchicalPrototyping</code> class is responsible for initializing and updating prototypes, calculating adaptive weights, and enforcing consistency between local and global prototypes.</p>
    <div class="code-block">
        <pre>
class HierarchicalPrototyping:
    def __init__(self, clients):
        # Initialize hierarchical prototyping with clients
        pass

    def initialize_prototypes(self):
        # Initialize global and local prototypes
        pass

    def calculate_adaptive_weights(self):
        # Calculate adaptive weights for prototypes
        pass

    def update_prototypes(self):
        # Update prototypes based on adaptive weights
        pass

    def enforce_consistency(self, mu=0.1, nu=0.1):
        # Enforce consistency between prototypes
        pass
        </pre>
    </div>

    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>Here is a basic example of how to use the framework:</p>
    <div class="code-block">
        <pre>
if __name__ == "__main__":
    data_handler = DataHandler('UCI Heart Disease')
    data_handler.prepare_data(batch_size=32)
    server = Server(num_clients=3)
    client1 = Client(1, data_handler.train_loader, data_handler.val_loader, data_handler.test_loader)
    client2 = Client(2, data_handler.train_loader, data_handler.val_loader, data_handler.test_loader)
    client3 = Client(3, data_handler.train_loader, data_handler.val_loader, data_handler.test_loader)
    server.register_client(client1)
    server.register_client(client2)
    server.register_client(client3)
    server.federated_train()
        </pre>
    </div>

    <h2>Future Work</h2>
    <p>The following aspects of the code are still under development and will be updated in the future:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Completion of the <code>HierarchicalPrototyping</code> class, including more sophisticated loss calculations and prototype updates.</li>
        <li>Enhancement of the <code>SecureAggregator</code> class for better security and performance.</li>
        <li>Further optimization of the dynamic client selection mechanism, including more accurate energy consumption tracking and refined distance metrics for data diversity.</li>
        <li>Integration of additional datasets and models.</li>
    </ul>
